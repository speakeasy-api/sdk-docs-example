Some of the endpoints in this SDK support pagination. To use pagination, you make your SDK calls as usual, but the
returned response object will have a `next` method that can be called to pull down the next group of results. If the
return value of `next` is `null`, then there are no more pages to be fetched.

Here's an example of one such pagination call:


## [object Object]

```typescript copy
import { SDK } from "openapi";

(async () => {
    const sdk = new SDK({
        security: {
            apiKeyAuth: "Token YOUR_API_KEY",
        },
        globalPathParam: 100,
        globalQueryParam: "some example global query param",
    });

    const res = await sdk.pagination.paginationCursorBody({
        cursor: 868337,
    });

    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        do {
            // handle items

            res = res.next();
        } while (res);
    }
})();

```
