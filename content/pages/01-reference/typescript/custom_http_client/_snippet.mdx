{/* Start Typescript Custom HTTP Client */}
The Typescript SDK makes API calls using the [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) HTTP library.  In order to provide a convenient way to configure timeouts, cookies, proxies, custom headers, and other low-level configuration, you can initialize the SDK client with a custom `AxiosInstance` object.

For example, you could specify a header for every request that your sdk makes as follows:

```typescript
import { openapi } from "SDK";
import axios from "axios";

const httpClient = axios.create({
    headers: {'x-custom-header': 'someValue'}
})

const sdk = new SDK({defaultClient: httpClient});
```
{/* End Typescript Custom HTTP Client */}
