The SDK can either be compiled using `dotnet build` and the resultant `.dll` file can be copied into your Unity project's `Assets` folder, or you can copy the source code directly into your project.

The SDK relies on Newtonsoft's JSON.NET Package which can be installed via the Unity Package Manager.

To do so open the Package Manager via `Window > Package Manager` and click the `+` button then `Add package from git URL...` and enter `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` and click `Add`.
