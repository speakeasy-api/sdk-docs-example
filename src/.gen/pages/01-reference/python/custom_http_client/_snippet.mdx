{/* Start Python Custom HTTP Client */}
The Python SDK makes API calls using the (requests)[https://pypi.org/project/requests/] HTTP library.  In order to provide a convenient way to configure timeouts, cookies, proxies, custom headers, and other low-level configuration, you can initialize the SDK client with a custom `requests.Session` object.

For example, you could specify a header for every request that this sdk makes as follows:
```python
import sdk
import requests

http_client = requests.Session()
http_client.headers.update({'x-custom-header': 'someValue'})
s = sdk.SDK(client: http_client)
```
{/* End Python Custom HTTP Client */}
