Some of the endpoints in this SDK support pagination. To use pagination, you make your SDK calls as usual, but the
returned response object will have a `next` method that can be called to pull down the next group of results. If the
return value of `next` is `null`, then there are no more pages to be fetched.

Here's an example of one such pagination call:


## [object Object]

```python copy
import sdk
from sdk.models import operations, shared

s = sdk.SDK(
    security=shared.Security(
        api_key_auth="Token YOUR_API_KEY",
    ),
    global_path_param=100,
    global_query_param='some example global query param',
)

req = operations.PaginationCursorBodyRequestBody(
    cursor=868337,
)

res = s.pagination.pagination_cursor_body(req)

if res.res is not None:
    while True:
        # handle items

        res = res.Next()
        if res is None:
            break

```
